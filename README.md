Quantitative algorithms for investing stock market portfolio.

I have developed a number of quanitative algorithms for investing public equities according to the investment principles of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.  Some of the ideas are based on the book "Buffettology" and "New Buffettology" by Mary Buffett (former daughter-in-law of Warren Buffett).  

I will publish some of the data gathering techniques based on the GuruFocus REST API.  However, I will not publish the specific algorithms that drive the investment decisions.
